# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Journey

Welcome to my FastAPI experimentation repository! This is where I explore and learn different components of FastAPI through small, focused experiments.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains various FastAPI experiments and examples as I learn the framework. Each experiment focuses on specific FastAPI features and concepts, helping me build a comprehensive understanding of modern Python web development.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- [ ] Basic FastAPI setup and routing
- [ ] Request and response handling
- [ ] Data validation with Pydantic
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Middleware implementation
- [ ] WebSocket connections
- [ ] Background tasks
- [ ] Testing FastAPI applications
- [ ] Deployment strategies

## 📁 Experiments

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **Python 3.8+** - Programming language
- **Uvicorn** - ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
- **Pydantic** - Data validation using Python type annotations

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv fastapi-env
source fastapi-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fastapi-env\Scripts\activate

# Install FastAPI and dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

### Running Experiments
```bash
# Run any experiment file
uvicorn filename:app --reload

# Example:
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
